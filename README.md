Welcome to the Coding Theory Calculator GitHub page! This repository contains the source code for my Coding Theory Calculator webpage, which is designed to help you solve a variety of coding theory related problems, including calculating the Hamming distance, decoding Hamming codes, C24 decoding, syndrome decoding, and more.

## About

I created this website because I could not find any online tools to help me solve coding theory related computational problems when taking the Coding Theory course CO331 at the University of Waterloo. I have obtained the permission of Professor Alfred Menezes to publish this website. Apart from the calculators themselves, this website contains some basic definitions on each page.

## Built With

This website is created using the following technologies:

- Next.js
- TailwindCSS
- Express
- Node.js
